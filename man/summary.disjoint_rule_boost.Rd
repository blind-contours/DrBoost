\title{Summarize a Disjoint Rule Boosting model}
\usage{
\method{summary}{disjoint_rule_boost}(object, X_train = NULL, Y_train = NULL, digits = 3, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class "disjoint_rule_boost"}

\item{X_train}{optional matrix/data.frame of training features
(same shape used for disjoint_rule_boost).}

\item{Y_train}{optional numeric or binary outcomes (length=nrow(X_train)).}

\item{digits}{how many decimal places to show for coefficients}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
invisibly returns a data frame summarizing each rule:
\itemize{
\item region_index,
\item coverage (# training rows that fall in that bounding box, if X_train is given),
\item leftover (TRUE/FALSE if infinite bounding box),
\item model_type,
\item coefs (short string),
\item mean_in_region (if Y_train is provided),
\item rule_text (if you used the 'rule_text' in region_info).
}
}
\description{
S3 method for class "disjoint_rule_boost" that prints out
each bounding box, coverage, local model type, and (optionally)
the mean outcome in that region.
}
